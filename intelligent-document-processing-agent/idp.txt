Building a real IDP pipeline that:
classifies documents
extracts structured data
validates outputs
routes documents
escalates to humans when required
is async, scalable and auditable


Problem it solves:
Enterprises process invoices, contracts, insurance claims, KYC documents, medical forms

Manual processing problems: slow, error , expensive, non auditable

IDP replaces this with: automated classification, structured extraction, confidence based routing, human review only when needed

Core Design Principles: 
Documents are untrusted input
LLMs never directly modify state
Schemas are contracts
Low confidence -> human
Everything is logged
Pipelines > agents
