Multi Tenant Enterprise RAG platform

Companies want: 
One AI platform
Many customers
Each tenant: owns its own data, has isolated memory, has cost limits, has custom prompts, must never leak data

Naive RAG fails because: shared vector stores leak data, prompts are global, costs explodes, one tenant can DOS others, no isolation guarantees


Core Design: This system guarantees
Hard tenant isolation, Per tenant vector stores, per tenant prompt versions, per tenant cost budgets, per tenant model routing, auditable decisions, safe defaults
