Building a resume tailoring system that:
Parses resume safely
Understands job descriptions
Tailors output using structured data
Routes model by cost
handles failures


Problem Statement: Recruiters and Candidates want 
Resume summaries aligned to a JD, no hallucinated skills, Deterministic proffessional output, cheap execution for simple cases, reliable structure for automation

Naive GPT usage fails because: free text outputs breaks ATS pipelines, prompt drift changes tone, cost explode, no validation


Langchain gives us: prompt discipline, structured outputs, retry + fallback, cost aware routing, composable DAGs

Raw SDK calls cannot do this clearly.


High Level Architecture

Resume + JD
   ↓
Analyzer (cheap, no retry)
   ↓
If simple
   → simple_chain (retry)
If deep
   → deep_chain (retry)
      ↓ (fails)
   → fallback: simple_chain
